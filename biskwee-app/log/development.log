		"Place water, milk, butter, condensed milk, and salt into saucepan and bring to a full rolling boil.",
		"Add the flour all at once to the boiling mixture. Stir with wooden spoon or heatproof spatula until a
smooth mass forms.",
"Keep cooking and stirring it around over moderate heat to dry out the dough as much as possible, about
2-3 minutes.",
"Transfer dough to mixer bowl. With the paddle attachment, beat at medium speed to release steam and
cool a bit for one minute.",
"At low speed, beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating until incorporated between additions.
The dough should look smooth and glossy, stiff but not dry.",
